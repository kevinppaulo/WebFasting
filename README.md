## WebFasting
A simple web based replacement for the app Zero. Since there aren't any good **web based** [intermittent fasting](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/intermittent-fasting-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work) apps, I made my own. Most apps are made only for Android or IOS without a web verision.

## Note about heroku
This app is hosted in heroku's free dyno. Therefore it should take about a minute to load the app in the first time.
